# TickTick MCP Server

A [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) server for TickTick that enables interacting with your TickTick task management system directly through Claude and other MCP clients.

## Features

- 📋 View all your TickTick projects and tasks
- ✏️ Create new projects and tasks through natural language
- 🔄 Update existing task details (title, content, dates, priority)
- ✅ Mark tasks as complete
- 🗑️ Delete tasks and projects
- 🔄 Full integration with TickTick's open API
- 🔌 Seamless integration with Claude and other MCP clients

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or higher
- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) - Fast Python package installer and resolver
- TickTick account with API access
- TickTick API credentials (Client ID, Client Secret, Access Token)

## Installation

1. **Clone this repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jacepark12/ticktick-mcp.git
   cd ticktick-mcp
   ```

2. **Install with uv**:
   ```bash
   # Install uv if you don't have it already
   curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

   # Create a virtual environment
   uv venv

   # Activate the virtual environment
   # On macOS/Linux:
   source .venv/bin/activate
   # On Windows:
   .venv\Scripts\activate

   # Install the package
   uv pip install -e .
   ```

3. **Authenticate with TickTick**:
   ```bash
   # Run the authentication flow
   uv run -m ticktick_mcp.cli auth
   ```

   This will:
   - Ask for your TickTick Client ID and Client Secret
   - Open a browser window for you to log in to TickTick
   - Automatically save your access tokens to a `.env` file

4. **Test your configuration**:
   ```bash
   uv run test_server.py
   ```
   This will verify that your TickTick credentials are working correctly.

## Authentication with TickTick

This server uses OAuth2 to authenticate with TickTick. The setup process is straightforward:

1. Register your application at the [TickTick Developer Center](https://developer.ticktick.com/manage)
   - Set the redirect URI to `http://localhost:8000/callback`
   - Note your Client ID and Client Secret

2. Run the authentication command:
   ```bash
   uv run -m ticktick_mcp.cli auth
   ```

3. Follow the prompts to enter your Client ID and Client Secret

4. A browser window will open for you to authorize the application with your TickTick account

5. After authorizing, you'll be redirected back to the application, and your access tokens will be automatically saved to the `.env` file

The server handles token refresh automatically, so you won't need to reauthenticate unless you revoke access or delete your `.env` file.

## Remote MCP Deployment

This fork can run either as a local stdio MCP server or as a remote HTTP MCP server.

Local stdio mode:
```bash
python -m ticktick_mcp.cli run --transport stdio
```

Remote SSE mode:
```bash
python -m ticktick_mcp.cli run --transport sse --host 0.0.0.0
```

Remote endpoints:

- SSE endpoint: `/sse`
- SSE message endpoint: `/messages/`
- Streamable HTTP endpoint, if enabled: `/mcp`

For Docker-based hosts such as Render, Fly, Railway, or a VPS:

```bash
docker build -t ticktick-mcp .
docker run --env-file .env -p 8000:8000 ticktick-mcp
```

Required remote environment variables:

```env
TICKTICK_CLIENT_ID=...
TICKTICK_CLIENT_SECRET=...
TICKTICK_ACCESS_TOKEN=...
TICKTICK_REFRESH_TOKEN=...
MCP_TRANSPORT=sse
MCP_HOST=0.0.0.0
MCP_PORT=8000
MCP_PUBLIC_URL=https://your-public-domain.example
```

Recommended ChatGPT OAuth protection:

```env
MCP_AUTH_MODE=oauth
MCP_OAUTH_PASSWORD=your-private-login-password
MCP_OAUTH_TOKEN_SECRET=generate-a-long-random-token
MCP_OAUTH_ACCESS_TOKEN_TTL_SECONDS=3600
MCP_OAUTH_REFRESH_TOKEN_TTL_SECONDS=7776000
MCP_ALLOWED_HOSTS=your-public-domain.example
MCP_ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://chatgpt.com,https://chat.openai.com
```

`MCP_AUTH_MODE=oauth` enables a single-user OAuth 2.1 flow for ChatGPT. ChatGPT registers as an OAuth client, opens `/oauth/login`, and receives signed MCP access and refresh tokens after you enter `MCP_OAUTH_PASSWORD`. TickTick tokens remain server-side in environment variables.

Bearer-token clients are still supported with:

```env
MCP_AUTH_MODE=bearer
MCP_AUTH_TOKEN=generate-a-long-random-token
```

Do not deploy this publicly with `MCP_AUTH_MODE=none`. The MCP tools can read and mutate TickTick tasks.

### Connecting from ChatGPT

After deployment, the remote MCP server URL is:

```text
https://your-public-domain.example/sse
```

Use that URL when adding a custom MCP app/server in ChatGPT.

For ChatGPT, choose OAuth authentication. Dynamic Client Registration should discover:

- Authorization URL: `https://your-public-domain.example/authorize`
- Token URL: `https://your-public-domain.example/token`
- Registration URL: `https://your-public-domain.example/register`
- Scopes: `ticktick:read ticktick:write`

Write tools require the `ticktick:write` scope. Read access to the MCP transport requires `ticktick:read`.

## Authentication with Dida365

[滴答清单 - Dida365](https://dida365.com/home) is China version of TickTick, and the authentication process is similar to TickTick. Follow these steps to set up Dida365 authentication:

1. Register your application at the [Dida365 Developer Center](https://developer.dida365.com/manage)
   - Set the redirect URI to `http://localhost:8000/callback`
   - Note your Client ID and Client Secret

2. Add environment variables to your `.env` file:
   ```env
   TICKTICK_BASE_URL='https://api.dida365.com/open/v1'
   TICKTICK_AUTH_URL='https://dida365.com/oauth/authorize'
   TICKTICK_TOKEN_URL='https://dida365.com/oauth/token'
   ```

3. Follow the same authentication steps as for TickTick

## Example Prompts for Claude

Here are some example prompts to use with Claude after connecting the TickTick MCP server:

### General

- "Show me all my TickTick projects"
- "Create a new task called 'Finish MCP server documentation' in my work project with high priority"
- "List all tasks in my personal project"
- "Mark the task 'Buy groceries' as complete"
- "Create a new project called 'Vacation Planning' with a blue color"
- "When is my next deadline in TickTick?"

### Task Filtering Queries

- "What tasks do I have due today?"
- "Show me everything that's overdue"
- "Show me all tasks due this week"
- "Search for tasks about 'project alpha'"
- "Show me all tasks with 'client' in the title or description"
- "Show me all my high priority tasks"

### GTD Workflow

Following David Allen's "Getting Things Done" framework, manage an Engaged and Next actions.

- Engaged will retrieve tasks of high priority, due today or overdue.
- Next will retrieve medium priority or due tomorrow.
- Break down complex actions into smaller actions with batch_creation

For example:

- "Time block the rest of my day from 2-8pm with items from my engaged list"
- "Walk me through my next actions and help my identify what I should focus on tomorrow?" 
- "Break down this project into 5 smaller actionable tasks"

```

### Authentication Flow

The project implements a complete OAuth 2.0 flow for TickTick:

1. **Initial Setup**: User provides their TickTick API Client ID and Secret
2. **Browser Authorization**: User is redirected to TickTick to grant access
3. **Token Reception**: A local server receives the OAuth callback with the authorization code
4. **Token Exchange**: The code is exchanged for access and refresh tokens
5. **Token Storage**: Tokens are securely stored in the local `.env` file
6. **Token Refresh**: The client automatically refreshes the access token when it expires

This simplifies the user experience by handling the entire OAuth flow programmatically.
